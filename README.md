# ShoePriceFinder
This project was created for searching shoes in many shops at once. Now searching can be automated and chances of missing price cut are reduced.
This program produces xls (Excel) file that can be fast analized by human.

 IF YOU TYPE SOMETHING LIKE 'adidas' results may include other clothes, other than shoes. However, it depends on the shop and its architecture.
WEBSITES HTML MAY ALSO CHANGE IN TIME, SO YOU CAN EXPECT MANY BUGS AFTER LONG TIME ;)

Result of searching:
shoeName: air force 1
size: 47.5
gender: MALE
